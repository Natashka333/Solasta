										<h2 class="major">My Story</h2>
										<p>Many of us have experienced traumatic events even at the earliest of ages. I carried the
											pain from my childhood in silence, smiling through the pain. I felt deeply insecure and
											inadequate, learning very early on how to give my power and essence away in
											relationships. Because I was terrified of being alone, I allowed the boundaries I set to be
											repeatedly and callously ignored. I became disconnected from my own feelings and
											needs, abandoning myself and my dreams somewhere along the way.
											
										<p>I was an unwed mother at the age of 23 and had two failed marriages by the time I was
											47. A marriage should be the safest place to share your deepest hurts, your biggest
											sins, the ugliest things about yourself as well as the most beautiful. A place where
											you’re not frightened of the one you give your heart to. After my second divorce, I
											walked away with the understanding that when safety is missing, there is no
											relationship. Finally, I had had enough. I was on a mission to find out why I kept
											choosing the same type of men, when I came across Conscious Uncoupling. What I
											discovered was more empowering than I could have imagined. Working through the
											steps of the program, I became aware of and also willing to take responsibility for my
											part in the harmful cycles I was playing out with others. When you’re able to lovingly
											accept your part in co-creating the good and bad relationships in your life, you then
											become empowered to create the life and relationships you’re worthy of.</p>	
											
											I am now in a loving, supportive, and mutually respectful relationship where we share
											open communication. I’m a certified Conscious Uncoupling Coach and have my life
											coaching certification through the Jay Shetty Certification School in London, which is
											accredited by the Association for Coaching®.
											
											There is no easy way to have your heart broken; however, if you want to free yourself
											from the past, and the limiting beliefs and behaviors keeping you stuck while at the
											same time learn how to safely be in a relationship where you speak your truth, I
											encourage you to schedule a free 30-minute discovery call with me. I’m looking forward
											to guiding you to grow beyond your pain and struggle.</p>

										<h2 class="major">What does Solasta mean?</h2>
										<p>Solasta: meaning luminous or shining in Scottish Gaelic. In honor of my Scottish heritage as well as the desire in my heart to help shine a light, especially in the dark times of a breakup or divorce, I chose Solasta for the name of my business…my passion. My intention in creating Solasta is to help people like me navigate the experience of heartbreak through a transformational process of awareness, healing, and growth that will serve you for the rest of your life. Allow me the honor of guiding you out of the darkness of heartbreak and into the brilliant light of the life and love you truly desire.</p>
